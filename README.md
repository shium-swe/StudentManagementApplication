# Student Management Application
A student management database where you could add student information such as name, grade year, courses, etc. First you (the admin) is prompted for the number of students to add to the database. Then you fill out information on the student and the courses there taking. You are then given the total tuition and the you could put in the student's payment. Finally, you will be see the balance and some information on the specific student such as their individual student ID.

## What I learned
* More implementation of Java OOP concepts and techniques
* Use of the ArrayList data structure
* Use of do/while loop
* Use of StringBuffer class
* Iterating through the creation of multiple objects
